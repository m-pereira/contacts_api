# Contacts api

Hi there! this is my first api with ruby on rails.
Here I learned how to build a simple api to handle contacts.

## You can download it and use in your local:

* First you need to clone the code:
  
  SSH key:

      $ git clone git@github.com:m-pereira/contacts_api.git
  
  or this one:

      $ git clone https://github.com/m-pereira/contacts_api.git

* The you need to run bundle to install the gems needed:

      $ bundle install

* Now you need to start the rails server:

      $ rails server

* Now you may be able to see the api running.

You can use curl, postman or another way to see that. Enjoy it!
